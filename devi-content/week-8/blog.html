    <h2>Hello Beautiful People 💜</h2>
    <p class="lead">
      Hey loves 💜 I've been scanning U.S. fashion feeds all week, and the repeat looks are impossible to miss.
      This feels like one of those weeks where outfits look relaxed — but very intentional.
      The vibe right now is all about balance: oversized layers paired with clean bases, flowy pieces grounded with structure,
      and silhouettes that feel effortless but still sharp on camera.
      Oversized blazers are back in full force, flowy midi dresses are everywhere again,
      and wide-leg trousers continue to dominate — but styled cleaner and more refined.
      Burgundy, cream, and sage are leading the palette, with textures like soft knits, tailored suiting,
      and smooth leather showing up across feeds.
      People aren’t chasing drama this week. They’re chasing polish.

    <h2>This Week's Must-Know Trends 🔥</h2>

    <h3>Trend 1: Oversized blazers layered over fitted basics.</h3>
    <p>
      This is EVERYWHERE right now. I keep seeing oversized blazers thrown over fitted turtlenecks,
      slim knits, or clean tanks, and it works every single time.
      The contrast between structure and softness makes outfits feel styled without trying too hard.
    </p>
    <p><strong>How to style it:</strong> Keep the base simple and fitted. Neutral tones work best.
      Let the blazer carry the look and avoid heavy accessories.</p>

    </p>

    <h3>Trend 2: Flowy midi dresses paired with chunky ankle boots.</h3>
    <p>
      This combo is everywhere right now because it balances softness with weight.
      The movement of a flowy midi dress paired with chunky boots makes outfits feel modern,
      grounded, and very wearable — not overly romantic.
    </p>
    <p><strong>How to style it:</strong>
      Keep the dress silhouette simple and let the boots anchor the outfit.
      Add a cropped jacket or blazer if you want more structure.

    </p>

    <h3>Trend 3: High-waisted wide-leg trousers styled clean and sharp.</h3>
    <p>
      Wide-leg trousers are still everywhere, but the styling has shifted.
      High waists paired with fitted or cropped tops keep proportions long and polished
      instead of oversized all over.
    </p>
    <p><strong>How to style it:</strong>
      Balance volume with structure. A fitted knit, cropped sweater,
      or tucked-in top works best.
