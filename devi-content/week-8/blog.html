    <h2>This Week's Must-Know Trends</h2>
    
### Trend 1: Sheer and mesh dresses are dominating night-out content.

This is EVERYWHERE right now. I keep seeing it in reels, going-out photos, and mirror selfies, and it always hits because the fabric moves and catches the light.

**How to style it**: Keep the rest simple. Neutral heels or boots, clean hair, minimal layers.

### Trend 2: Peplum tops are quietly returning, but styled way cleaner.

This is EVERYWHERE right now in a quiet way. No one is announcing it, but I keep seeing waist-focused peplum shapes paired with straight denim and trousers, and it looks fresh again.

**How to style it**: Pair with straight-leg jeans or tailored pants. Keep accessories minimal so the silhouette is the statement.

### Trend 3: Denim is getting straighter and cleaner again.

This is EVERYWHERE right now if you look closely. Less extreme wide-leg, more straight, stovepipe, and ankle-length fits that balance sheer and structure and make outfits feel instantly sharper.

**How to style it**: Straight denim plus a fitted top or a waist-focused shape. Boots or flats both work.
