<h1>COLLABORATION & PAYMENT POLICY</h1>

<div class="header-info">
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 29, 2026</p>
    <p><strong>Creator/Service Provider:</strong> Devi (AI Content Creator & Digital Influencer)</p>
    <p><strong>Document Version:</strong> 1.0</p>
</div>

<hr>

<h2>1. SCOPE OF SERVICES</h2>

<p>This Collaboration & Payment Policy (the "Policy") applies to all paid collaborations, AI-generated content, digital influencer services, and content licensing agreements entered into with Devi (the "Creator").</p>

<p>All deliverables, scope of work, and specific requirements must be agreed upon in writing before any payment is processed. Written agreements may include email correspondence, signed contracts, or documented briefing materials that clearly outline the expected deliverables.</p>

<p>This Policy governs the terms under which the Creator provides services and the conditions under which payments are made and processed.</p>

<h2>2. PAYMENT TERMS</h2>

<h3>2.1 Upfront Payment Requirement</h3>
<p>Full upfront payment is required to secure production and reserve the Creator's time and resources. No work will commence until payment has been received and confirmed.</p>

<h3>2.2 Payment Deadline</h3>
<p>Payment must be completed within 48 hours of the agreement confirmation. Failure to complete payment within this timeframe may result in the cancellation of the agreement without further obligation from the Creator.</p>

<h3>2.3 Accepted Payment Methods</h3>
<p>The Creator accepts the following payment methods:</p>
<ul>
    <li>PayPal (business transactions)</li>
    <li>Bank Transfer (wire transfer or direct deposit)</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional payment methods may be considered on a case-by-case basis and must be confirmed in writing prior to agreement finalization.</p>

<h3>2.4 Commencement of Work</h3>
<p>Work will begin only after payment has been received, cleared, and confirmed by the Creator. The Creator reserves the right to verify payment before commencing any services.</p>

<h2>3. DELIVERY TIMELINE</h2>

<h3>3.1 Standard Delivery Period</h3>
<p>Content delivery will be completed within up to 30 days from the date of confirmed payment receipt, unless otherwise agreed upon in writing.</p>

<h3>3.2 Timeline Variations</h3>
<p>The delivery timeline may vary based on the scope, complexity, and specific requirements of the project. Any extended timelines will be communicated and agreed upon before work begins.</p>

<h3>3.3 Delivery Method</h3>
<p>Final deliverables will be provided via digital transfer methods such as email, cloud storage links, or other mutually agreed-upon platforms.</p>

<div class="page-break"></div>

<h2>4. REVISIONS & QUALITY ASSURANCE</h2>

<h3>4.1 Included Revisions</h3>
<p>One reasonable revision round is included in the base service fee. Revisions must be requested within 7 days of initial delivery.</p>

<h3>4.2 Scope of Revisions</h3>
<p>Revisions must align with the original brief and scope of work. Minor adjustments, corrections, and refinements are considered reasonable revisions.</p>

<h3>4.3 Excluded from Revisions</h3>
<p>The following are not included in the standard revision round:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Full concept changes or complete redesigns</li>
    <li>Changes to the original brief or deliverables</li>
    <li>Additional content beyond the agreed scope</li>
    <li>Requests that significantly alter the approved direction</li>
</ul>
<p>Any such changes will require a separate agreement and may incur additional fees.</p>

<h2>5. REFUND & CANCELLATION POLICY</h2>

<h3>5.1 No Refunds After Work Commencement</h3>
<p>Once work has started, no refunds will be issued. Work is considered to have started upon receipt and confirmation of payment.</p>

<h3>5.2 Material Deviation from Brief</h3>
<p>If the final output materially deviates from the agreed-upon brief through the Creator's error, revisions will be offered first to rectify the issue at no additional cost.</p>

<h3>5.3 Partial Refunds in Exceptional Cases</h3>
<p>In exceptional circumstances where the final output cannot be reasonably adjusted to meet the agreed brief, a partial refund of up to 30% of the total fee may be issued at the Creator's sole discretion.</p>

<h3>5.4 No Refunds for Subjective Matters</h3>
<p>No refunds will be issued for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Subjective taste or personal preference</li>
    <li>Performance results (e.g., engagement rates, sales conversions)</li>
    <li>Change of mind after approval of the brief</li>
    <li>Third-party platform algorithm changes</li>
    <li>Market conditions or competitive factors</li>
</ul>

<h3>5.5 Cancellation Before Payment</h3>
<p>Either party may cancel the agreement before payment is made without any obligation or penalty.</p>

<h2>6. USAGE & LICENSING</h2>

<h3>6.1 Rights Grant Upon Payment</h3>
<p>Content usage rights are granted to the client only after full payment has been received and cleared.</p>

<h3>6.2 Standard Usage Rights</h3>
<p>Unless otherwise specified in writing, the client receives standard usage rights for the agreed-upon platforms and duration as outlined in the brief.</p>

<h3>6.3 Extended or Additional Usage</h3>
<p>Any additional usage, extended licensing, exclusive rights, or usage beyond the originally agreed scope requires written approval from the Creator and may incur additional licensing fees.</p>

<h3>6.4 Creator Portfolio Rights</h3>
<p>The Creator reserves the right to use the created content for portfolio purposes, case studies, and promotional materials unless exclusivity is explicitly purchased and agreed upon in writing.</p>

<div class="page-break"></div>

<h2>7. TERMINATION</h2>

<h3>7.1 Termination Before Payment</h3>
<p>Either party may terminate the agreement before payment is made without any obligation or financial liability.</p>

<h3>7.2 Termination After Payment</h3>
<p>Once payment has been made and confirmed, termination by the client does not entitle the client to a refund, as resources have been allocated and work has commenced.</p>

<h3>7.3 Creator's Right to Terminate</h3>
<p>The Creator reserves the right to terminate the agreement if the client engages in:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Abusive, harassing, or unprofessional conduct</li>
    <li>Providing false or misleading information</li>
    <li>Failure to provide necessary materials or information</li>
    <li>Breach of this Policy or any related agreements</li>
</ul>
<p>In such cases, no refund will be issued.</p>

<h2>8. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS</h2>

<h3>8.1 Agreement to Policy</h3>
<p>By proceeding with payment, the client confirms that they have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this Collaboration & Payment Policy.</p>

<h3>8.2 Superseding Agreements</h3>
<p>This Policy applies to all collaborations unless a separate written contract explicitly supersedes specific terms. In cases of conflict, the more recent written agreement will prevail.</p>

<h3>8.3 Amendments</h3>
<p>The Creator reserves the right to amend this Policy at any time. Amendments will apply to agreements entered into after the effective date of the updated Policy. Current clients will be governed by the Policy version in effect at the time of their agreement.</p>

<h3>8.4 Communication</h3>
<p>All official communications, agreements, and notices related to this Policy should be conducted via email or other written methods that provide a clear record of correspondence.</p>

<h2>9. GENERAL PROVISIONS</h2>

<h3>9.1 Governing Law</h3>
<p>This Policy shall be governed by and construed in accordance with applicable local laws.</p>

<p>If any provision of this Policy is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect.</p>
